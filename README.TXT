# Sorting Algorithms in Java 🔢

This repo contains multiple classic sorting algorithms implemented from scratch in Java, along with benchmarking code to compare performance.

It was originally built as a data structures and algorithms learning project.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm is implemented in-place and can be benchmarked using `SortingBenchmarkV1.java`.

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

Run `SortingBenchmarkV1.java` to compare runtime performance of each algorithm on randomized input.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java 17
- BlueJ (development environment)
- CLI-based execution

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Algorithm design patterns
- Trade-offs between time complexity and space
- Recursive vs iterative strategies
- Benchmarking and performance profiling in Java
